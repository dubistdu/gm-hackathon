Dash board UI made with jQuery Gauge to receive information through a facial recognition app created by my Hackathon Team

Each Gauge indicates Baby's emotion received from face recognition app.

App was inspired by and to prevent tragic accidents where babies are left in the car without driver's knowledge which usually ends up in fatal scenarios.

My task was to make UI and parse live JSON data from the APP and to make so it can properly display on UI
